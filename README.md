#### :satellite: Where I am right now

Although I started as a Front-end Dev, I'm currently working as a Full Stack Developer using AngularJS, NodeJS, NestJS and MongoDB,
but I got to be honest, React is my favorite framework.

#### ðŸŒ± What I am learning at the moment

I always try to improve my skills doing courses and resolving problems. At the moment I'm learning React Native to start
developing mobile apps. Besides that, studying S.O.L.I.D principles, TDD and other design patterns that makes sense
to the modern architecture.

Peopled web app is my favorite project, I'm trying to give people the option to choose the best entertainment for them.
